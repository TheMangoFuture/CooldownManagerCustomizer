WoW addon that allows you to hide or show abilities/buffs from the default Blizzard Cooldown Manager added in WoW 11.1.5

Commands:
<li>/cmc config - Opens the configuration window</li>
<li>/cmc hide <SpellID> - Hides a spell</li>
<li>/cmc show <SpellID> - Shows a spell</li>
<li>/cmc toggle <SpellID> - Toggles hiding a spell</li>
<li>/cmc list - Lists currently hidden SpellIDs</li>
<li>/cmc refresh - Manually refreshes the CooldownViewer UI</li>
<br/>

You will need to know the spell or buff ID to hide it.
NOTE: I plan on adding a spell list and things later on, but I wanted this out for the initial 11.1.5 release.  

You can find the spell ID in the URL of  the spell on Wowhead, or by mousing over a spell in game (I have the spell ID showing in your tooltip by default included in the addon)
EXAMPLE: https://www.wowhead.com/spell=206930/heart-strike  
the "206930" is what you'll type in to hide Heart Strike from your bar if you're playing a Death Knight.  

Please report any bugs you encounter, but also request new features! 
I will continue to improve the addon and add features.  

This is my first WoW addon after being a playing since 2004. I appreciate you trying this out!  


Thanks,
